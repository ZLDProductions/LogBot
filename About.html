      <h1>About LogBot</h1>
      <p>LogBot performs several tasks every time a message is sent or an event
        occurs. Because of this, I have been forced to split it up into at least
        11 separately running programs to keep it fast. This is understandable,
        as the bot has over 100 commands.</p>
      <p>The bot stores data for future review by the server admins. It was
        originally created to perform this task and this task only, but it has
        since then changed into something even better: a multipurpose bot that
        makes things generally easier to do.</p>
      <p>There's a built-in bible (no copyright versions), a swearing filter, a
        dictionary, Wikipedia, Wolfram|Alpha, polling, a levels module, lots of
        security, message logging, and more.</p>
      <p>If you wish to contact me, my Discord tag is JVOD#6496. Join LogBot HQ
        (link in Links) and talk to me.<br>
