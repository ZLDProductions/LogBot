## Self-Run Instances
    Currently, you cannot run the bot locally on your computer.
    I am working on 24/7 up-time, but it may take quite a while.

## Contributions
    I will accept contributions from users who have tested the bot in it's server, and ONLY from those who are familiar with Python.
    If you meet these standards, and wish to participate, contact me through Discord, and ask if you can.
    Currently, I am looking for performance improvements, security improvements, and new features to add.
