			This bot was made to help users with a great deal of things.<br>
			It's evolved over time, with the help of you, the users, to have so many commands that I needed thiw website to organize them.<br>
			Of course, they are all available in the bot itself. But this site is meant to be a tad bit more explanatory.<br>
			Nonetheless, in-program support will continue, as I hope your suggestions and bug reports will as well.<br>
